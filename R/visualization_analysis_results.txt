4. KEY STYLIZED FACTS: 
--------------------- 
Stylized Fact 1: Labor-Fertility Trade-off 
  Correlation coefficient: -0.095 
  Interpretation: Negative correlation supports the trade-off hypothesis 

Stylized Fact 2: Development-Fertility Relationship 
  Correlation coefficient: -0.445 
  Interpretation: Strong negative correlation confirms demographic transition theory 

Stylized Fact 3: Education-Fertility Relationship 
  Correlation coefficient: -0.252 
  Interpretation: Education empowerment leads to fertility decline 

Stylized Fact 4: Aging-Pension Sustainability Challenge 
  Correlation coefficient: 0.795 
  Interpretation: Strong positive correlation shows pension system pressure
